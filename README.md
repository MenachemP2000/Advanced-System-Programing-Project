# Advanced-System-Programing-Project
Advanced System Programing Project part 1

How we built the project:

we begun by creating a new jira project and creating tasks and then assigning different tasks to different team members,
each team member has done his tasks in separate github branch, and we pulled and merge from those feature branches to the main branch each time we finished a certain task, all the while tracking the progress in the jira project.
